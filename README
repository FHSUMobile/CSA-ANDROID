Here is the low down on what is going on here:

The csa folder contains the working version of the stand alone CSA Android app developed in eclipse. I know it is sloppy, 
but it works.... you should be able to compile this and run!

The MosaicAndroid folder is the folder generated by my bash script (Android-to-Mosaic) that downloads the sdk and does all the 
hard work of converting the stand alone app to Mosaic compatible. This particular folder contains the FINAL WORKING VERSION of csa 
that was uploaded to Mosaic and distributed. You can easily do a build of the source by running the Android-to-Mosaic script.
DO NOTE: the CSA source in this folder is not a direct copy of the standalone csa app. It was modified by the script and then 
required more modification afterwards. YOU CAN NOT reproduce that source code just be running the script. 

I apologize for how confusing this probably is. Please feel free to contact me to clear anything up.
