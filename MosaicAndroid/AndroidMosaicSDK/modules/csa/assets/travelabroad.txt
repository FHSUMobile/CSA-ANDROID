F-1, F-2 and J-1 students must come into the International Student Services Office to get the proper paperwork in place before leaving the U.S. and returning. If you have changed status, OR if your visa has expired, you must get a new visa before re-entering the U.S. To get a new visa you will need to have
your I-20 signed and additional information. Stop by the International Student Services office (Sheridan Hall, Room 208) if you have any questions.
